In this practice we'll learn how to do math in a finite field.

We'll define $\mathbb{F}_q$ as the [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) with $q$ elements.

In this practice we'll work in commutative rings defined as $\mathbb{Z}_q$. That is, for all integers we'll define an element in the ring as the remainder of division by $q$. A finite field can be thought of as a class, and the rings we form here are instances of the class.

<summary>Written in math notation: $\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists y \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ such that $y \equiv x$ mod $q$</summary>
"for all $x$ in the integers, there exists an element $y$ in the ring with $q$ elements over the integers, such that $y$ is equivalent to $x$ mod $q$"</details>

$\equiv$ denotes an equivalence relationship, specifically [congruence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry)). For example, if we're in $\mathbb{Z}_3$ we consider 1 and 4 to be congruent to each other. They are the same shape in $\mathbb{Z}_3$, but in different positions in $\mathbb{Z}$. [What is the difference between congruence and equality?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/915914/what-is-the-difference-between-congruency-and-equality)

In $\mathbb{Z}_{101}$

- $2 + 2 = $
- $2 * 2 = $
- $2^2 = $
- $2^8 = $
- $5*101 \equiv $

In $\mathbb{Z}_7$

- $1/4 = $
- $-4 \equiv $

Define $f(x) = 3 + 2x - x^2$

- $f(0) = $
- $f(5) = $
- Find the roots of $f(x)$
- Does $f(x)$ form a permutation of the ring?
